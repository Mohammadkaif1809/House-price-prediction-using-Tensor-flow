# House-price-prediction-using-Tensor-flow

House price prediction using TensorFlow typically involves building a machine learning model that can learn patterns and relationships in a dataset containing features related to houses (such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.) and their corresponding prices. TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning library, and it's often used for building and training neural networks.

Here's a brief description of the process for house price prediction using TensorFlow:

Data Collection:

Gather a dataset that includes information about various houses and their prices. The dataset should have features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and any other relevant information.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies. Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure that they are on a similar scale.

Feature Engineering:

Select and engineer relevant features that can contribute to the prediction task. This may involve creating new features or transforming existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data.

Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Model Architecture:

Choose a suitable neural network architecture for the regression task. In the case of house price prediction, a feedforward neural network or a more sophisticated architecture like a deep neural network could be appropriate.

Model Training:

Use TensorFlow to define, compile, and train the chosen model on the training dataset. During training, the model learns to map input features to house prices by adjusting its internal parameters.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to assess its performance. Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are commonly used for regression tasks.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model and repeat the training process to improve performance.

Prediction:

Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Deployment:

If the model meets the desired performance, it can be deployed to make predictions on real-world data, such as predicting house prices for a given set of features.
Throughout this process, TensorFlow provides a flexible and powerful framework for building and training machine learning models, allowing you to create sophisticated neural networks tailored to the specific requirements of your house price prediction task.
